# repetier-inkscape
Updated files for Inkscape 0.92.

This edited extension does not work with Inkscape 1.0 or later as it is not python 3 compliant. PLEASE USE THE INBUILT INKSCAPE EXTENSION: "Gcodetools > Path to Gcode" instead.

These files go in your \Inkscape\share\extensions folder.

Only the repetier.py file is changed from repetier's originals

see https://www.repetier.com/repetier-g-code-plugin-for-inskscape/ for full information

The discssion on how to fix the problem is at https://forum.inkscapecommunity.com/index.php?topic=486.0 search for gcodediff.txt and the discussion is immediately above the file link.
